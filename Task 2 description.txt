Task 2: Queries explaination

Query 1:

-- Create Customers table
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CUSTOMER_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME VARCHAR(100),
    EMAIL_ID VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    CONTACT_NO VARCHAR(15),
    ADDRESS TEXT
);

Explaination: This SQL statement creates a `Customers` table with five columns. The `CUSTOMER_ID` is a unique identifier that auto-generates for each customer. `NAME` stores the customer's name (up to 100 characters), and `EMAIL_ID` stores the customer's email, which must be unique. `CONTACT_NO` holds the customer's phone number, and `ADDRESS` stores the customer's address in text format. The `CUSTOMER_ID` is the primary key, ensuring each customer is uniquely identifiable in the table.

Query 2:

-- Create Suppliers table
CREATE TABLE Suppliers (
    SUPPLIER_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    CONTACT_NUMBER VARCHAR(15),
    SUPPLIER_NAME VARCHAR(100)
);

Explaination: This SQL statement creates a `Suppliers` table with three columns. The `SUPPLIER_ID` is an auto-incrementing unique identifier for each supplier, set as the primary key. The `CONTACT_NUMBER` column stores the supplier's phone number, and the `SUPPLIER_NAME` column stores the supplier's name, with a maximum length of 100 characters. The `SUPPLIER_ID` ensures that each supplier is uniquely identified.

Query 3:

-- Create Products table
CREATE TABLE Products (
    PRODUCT_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    NAME_OF_PRODUCT VARCHAR(100),
    PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION TEXT,
    PRICE_OF_PRODUCT DECIMAL(10, 2),
    STOCK_QUANTITY INT,
    SUPPLIER_ID INT REFERENCES Suppliers(SUPPLIER_ID)
);

Explaination: This SQL statement creates a Products table with six columns. The PRODUCT_ID is an auto-incrementing unique identifier for each product, set as the primary key. The NAME_OF_PRODUCT column stores the product's name, with a maximum of 100 characters. PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION holds a detailed description of the product, and PRICE_OF_PRODUCT stores the price, allowing up to two decimal places. STOCK_QUANTITY indicates the number of units available in stock, and SUPPLIER_ID is a foreign key that links each product to a supplier, referencing the SUPPLIER_ID from the Suppliers table. 


Query 4: 

-- Create Orders table
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    ORDER_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    CUSTOMER_ID INT REFERENCES Customers(CUSTOMER_ID),
    ORDER_DATE TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    TOTAL_AMOUNT DECIMAL(10, 2),
    SHIPPING_LOCATION TEXT,
    PAYMENT_MODE VARCHAR(50)
);

Explaination: This SQL statement creates an Orders table with six columns. The ORDER_ID is a unique, auto-incrementing identifier for each order, set as the primary key. The CUSTOMER_ID column is a foreign key that links the order to a specific customer by referencing the CUSTOMER_ID from the Customers table. ORDER_DATE stores the timestamp of when the order is placed, with a default value of the current timestamp. TOTAL_AMOUNT holds the total cost of the order, allowing two decimal places. SHIPPING_LOCATION stores the address where the order will be shipped, and PAYMENT_MODE indicates the method of payment, such as credit card or cash on delivery.

Query 5:

-- Create OrderDetails table
CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
    ORDER_DETAIL_ID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ORDER_ID INT REFERENCES Orders(ORDER_ID),
    PRODUCT_ID INT REFERENCES Products(PRODUCT_ID),
    QUANTITY INT,
    ORDER_PRICE DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Explaination: This SQL statement creates an OrderDetails table with five columns. The ORDER_DETAIL_ID is an auto-incrementing unique identifier for each order detail, set as the primary key. The ORDER_ID column is a foreign key that links each order detail to a specific order by referencing the ORDER_ID from the Orders table. The PRODUCT_ID column is another foreign key that connects each order detail to a specific product, referencing the PRODUCT_ID from the Products table. QUANTITY stores the number of units of the product ordered, and ORDER_PRICE represents the price of the product for that particular order, allowing two decimal places.

('Product C', 'Description C', 15.00, 75, 1),
('Product D', 'Description D', 25.00, 30, 3),
('Product E', 'Description E', 30.00, 20, 2);

Explaination: This SQL statement inserts sample data into the Products table, adding five rows of product information. Each row represents a product with details such as the NAME_OF_PRODUCT, PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION, PRICE_OF_PRODUCT, STOCK_QUANTITY, and SUPPLIER_ID. 

Query 9:

(2, 50.00, 'Location B', 'PayPal'),
(1, 75.00, 'Location C', 'Debit Card'),
(3, 200.00, 'Location D', 'Credit Card'),
(4, 150.00, 'Location E', 'Cash');

Explaination: This SQL statement inserts sample data into the Orders table, adding five rows of order information. Each row represents an order with details such as the CUSTOMER_ID, TOTAL_AMOUNT, SHIPPING_LOCATION, and PAYMENT_MODE. 

Query 10:

-- Insert sample data into OrderDetails
INSERT INTO OrderDetails (ORDER_ID, PRODUCT_ID, QUANTITY, ORDER_PRICE) VALUES
(1, 1, 2, 10.00),
(1, 2, 1, 20.00),
(2, 3, 3, 15.00),
(3, 4, 1, 25.00),
(4, 5, 2, 30.00);

Explaination: This SQL statement inserts sample data into the OrderDetails table, adding five rows of order detail information. Each row represents a specific product in an order, including the ORDER_ID, PRODUCT_ID, QUANTITY, and ORDER_PRICE. 


Query 11:

-- Retrieve Orders for a Specific Customer (CustomerID = 1 in this case)
SELECT 
    c.NAME AS CustomerName, 
    p.NAME_OF_PRODUCT AS ProductName, 
    o.ORDER_DATE, 
    od.QUANTITY
FROM 
    Orders o
JOIN 
    Customers c ON o.CUSTOMER_ID = c.CUSTOMER_ID
JOIN 
    OrderDetails od ON o.ORDER_ID = od.ORDER_ID
JOIN 
    Products p ON od.PRODUCT_ID = p.PRODUCT_ID
WHERE 
    c.CUSTOMER_ID = 1; -- Change this ID for different customers

Explaination: This SQL query retrieves all the orders placed by a specific customer (with CUSTOMER_ID = 1 in this case) and the corresponding product details for each order. It joins the Orders, Customers, OrderDetails, and Products tables to combine information. The query selects the customer's name, the product name, the order date, and the quantity of each product ordered. By using JOIN operations, it links the Orders table to the Customers table (to get the customer's name), the OrderDetails table (to get the product details), and the Products table (to fetch the product name). The WHERE clause filters the results to include only those orders that belong to the customer with CUSTOMER_ID = 1. This allows us to view all the products purchased by a specific customer, along with the details of each order.

Query 12:

-- Find the Most Purchased Product
SELECT 
    p.NAME_OF_PRODUCT AS ProductName, 
    SUM(od.QUANTITY) AS TotalPurchased
FROM 
    OrderDetails od
JOIN 
    Products p ON od.PRODUCT_ID = p.PRODUCT_ID
GROUP BY 
    p.NAME_OF_PRODUCT
ORDER BY 
    TotalPurchased DESC
LIMIT 1;

Explaination: This SQL query finds the most purchased product by summing the quantity of each product sold. It joins the OrderDetails table with the Products table to link each order detail with the corresponding product. The SUM(od.QUANTITY) function calculates the total quantity sold for each product. The query groups the results by NAME_OF_PRODUCT to ensure the sum is calculated per product. It then orders the results in descending order by the total quantity purchased, so the most purchased product appears first. The LIMIT 1 clause ensures that only the product with the highest total quantity is returned. This query helps identify the top-selling product in the database.


Query 13:

-- Update the Stock Quantity of a Product (ProductID = 1 in this case)
UPDATE Products
SET STOCK_QUANTITY = STOCK_QUANTITY - 1
WHERE PRODUCT_ID = 1; -- Change this ID for different products

Explaination: This SQL query updates the stock quantity of a specific product in the Products table by subtracting 1 from the STOCK_QUANTITY of the product with PRODUCT_ID = 1. The UPDATE statement modifies the stock for that particular product, and the WHERE clause ensures only the product with the specified PRODUCT_ID is affected. This is typically used to decrease the stock when a product is sold.

Query 14:

-- Delete a Customer's Record (CustomerID = 5 in this case)
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 5; -- Change this ID for different customers

Explaination: This SQL query deletes a customer's record from the Customers table. It removes the row where the CUSTOMER_ID equals 5. The DELETE FROM statement removes the entire record for that specific customer, and the WHERE clause ensures that only the customer with CUSTOMER_ID = 5 is deleted, preventing the removal of other customers' data. This operation is useful when a customer’s information needs to be completely erased from the database, and the WHERE clause ensures that only the targeted customer’s data is affected.
